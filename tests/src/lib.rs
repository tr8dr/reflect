//! The reflect library provides the following facilities:
//! - ability to register types for reflection
//! - fuzzy conversion functions, allowing for fuzzy matches in terms of argument matching
//!
//! The reflection macro finds ctors and method in an implementation of a type.  These
//! methods are then recorded and available to the reflection mechanism for type instance
//! creation and method invocation.
//!
//! Reflection allows for fuzzy matching for function arguments, where if, for example, a
//! vector of f64 is required and instead a vector of i64 is provided, if this is the best
//! fit method, before calling, the arguments will be transformed.
